# Giphy
I made an array of actions and buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
At the top of the page you can search your favorites. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
